<h1>Landons Arduino Ac</h1>
And Arduino project used for controlling heat and humidity.
The licensing that we will be using is the GNU General Public License v.3.0 the license is used for commercial, distribution and modification applications. With the ability to apply patents.

Edit by Daniela: I am thinking about improving this project by implementing a humidifier that does not automatically shut off,
one that can be **fully** controlled by the user.
